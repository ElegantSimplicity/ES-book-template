Initial meeting.

## 2020-10-14

Done:

* Watched some more Morse videos
   - Cancelation of critical points
   - Every 3-manifold is boundary of some 4-manifold (under certain conditions)
   - Some results needed for Heegaard decompositions
* Watched talk on Floer homology: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcggpesZ_kA)[Morse homology] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoLPZbLiAVo)[Floer homology]
* Made a dependency chart for the first chapter(s): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LSyxkRDMp2VspcCA4x9pddb7uIP2q3kl/view?usp=sharing
* Wrote a bit (WIP):
  - Introduction to transversally
  - Morse Lemma
  - Existence and abundance

Selection of discussed topics:

* Whitney embedding theorem (#3)
* Building manifolds
  - Embedding of attaching region up to isotopy
  - Collar neighbourhood theorem
* Typo in Audin-Damian?
* Good resources for Heegaard splittings? (#5)
* Building manifolds vs "given a manifold, decompose it"
* Coordinate free / dependent definition of Morse function
* Dehn twists

Takeaways:

* Preliminaries should only include things I learnt for this thesis. So e.g. not the definition of a manifold.
* Add page numbers to citations
* Level of detail in proofs should be higher than in books, videos, ...
* Check if there exists an errata for sources

Want to discuss:

* Doing a PhD at Leuven / ... (what's your experience in Leuven, Cambridge?)
