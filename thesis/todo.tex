    \item Spell check in brackets
    \item Handle decompositions / handlebody / handle body
    \item Citation pages!
    \item Search for TODOs
    \item search for 'we get' and replace by something nicer
    \item Morse Capital letter
    \item Citations for every theorem
    \item Remove instances of won't, don't, let's, \ldots
    \item Check sidecite / sidenote after fullstop
    \item Captions should end with a full stop.
    \item Other sphere of `other' sphere or `other sphere' or ditch name?
    \item w.r.t. and i.e. spacing
        \item Fix notation for cardinality $|X| $ or  $\# X$.
