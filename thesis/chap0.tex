\chapter{Preliminaries}

In this thesis, we assume the reader is familiar with the basics of differential geometry such as the concept of a smooth manifold, vector fields, flows, bundles, differential forms, et cetera.
In this chapter, we discuss some concepts that might be unfamiliar.

\section*{Transversality}
The first concept we want to introduce is transversality.

\begin{definition}[Transversality]
    Let $M$ be a manifold and $N_1, N_2$ be two submanifolds.
    Then $N_1$ intersects $N_2$ \emph{transversely} if and only if for all points of intersection $p \in N_1 \cap N_2$, we have
    $T_pM = T_pN_1 + T_p N_2$.
    We denote this by $ N_1 \tcap N_2$.\sidenotemark
\end{definition}
\sidenotetext{The notation is suggestive: the line $\cap$ intersects $|$ transversely $\tcap$.}
Note in particular that this depends on the ambient manifold $M$, and that if $N_1$ and $N_2$ do not intersect, their intersection is vacuously transverse.
We give some examples below.

    }

\end{figure}
If the intersection of two manifolds $ N_1, N_2$ is transverse, much more can be said about their intersection than in the general case.
In particular, the we are guaranteed that $N_1 \tcap N_2$ is again a manifold, which as Figure~\ref{fig:intersection-of-manifolds-is-not-always-a-manifold} shows it not always true.
\begin{marginfigure}

    \incfig{intersection-of-manifolds-is-not-always-a-manifold}
    \caption{Let $M = \R^2$ and let $N_1$ and $N_2$ be submanifolds as in the figure. Then $N_1$ and $N_2$ do not intersect transversely and their intersection is not a manifold: it is the union of a point and a closed interval.}
    \label{fig:intersection-of-manifolds-is-not-always-a-manifold}
\end{marginfigure}
\begin{prop}
    Let $M$ be a manifold and $N_1, N_2$ be two submanifolds. If $ N_1 \tcap N_2$, then $ N_1 \tcap N_2$ is again a manifold and 
    \[
        \codim (N_1 \tcap N_2) = \codim N_1 + \codim N_2
    ,\] 
    where the codimensions with respect to $M$, i.e. $\codim N_i = \dim M - \dim N_i$.
    Moreover, $T(N_1\tcap N_2) = TN_1 \tcap TN_2$.
\label{prop:transverse-codimensions-add}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    As this is a local statement, we prove it for $M = \R^{m}$.
    We may assume that $N_1 = f_1^{-1}(0)$ and $ N_2 = f_2^{-1}(0)$ where $f_i$ are submersions from $\R^{m}$ to $\R^{n_i}$, where $n_i$ is the codimension of $N_i$.
    % i.e. $(f_i)_*$ has full rank everywhere.
    Then we can also consider $F= (f_1, f_2): \R^{m} \to  \R^{n_1} \times \R^{n_2}$.
    Notice that $ N_1 \cap N_2 = F^{-1}(0)$.
    Then
    \begin{align*}
        \dim N_1 \cap  N_2 &= \dim \Ker d_0F\\
                           &= \dim(\Ker d_0 f_1 \cap \Ker d_0 f_2)\\
                           &= \dim \Ker d_0 f_1 + \dim \Ker d_0 f_2 - \dim (\Ker d_0 f_1 + \Ker d_0 f_2)\\
                           &= (m - n_1) + (m - n_2) - m\\
                           &= m - (n_1 + n_2)
    .\end{align*} 
    This also shows that $T_p(N_1 \tcap N_2) = T_pN_1 \tcap T_pN_2$ and that $ N_1 \tcap N_2$ is a manifold, which is not always the case when the intersection is not transverse.
\end{proof}

An interesting property of transversality is that it is both \emph{generic} and \emph{stable}.
By generic we mean that any two manifolds intersecting can be made intersecting transversely by perturbing one of the manifolds.
Stability on the other hand means that when we perturbate a transverse intersection, it stays transverse.
At the core of the proof of stability and genericness of transversality lies the theorem of Sard:
% In morse rigorous terms, we have the following:
% \begin{definition}[Stable]
%     A property $P$ is stable for a class $C$ of maps $f:M \to  N$ if for all $f \in C$ that satisfy $P$, we have that there any homotopy  $f_t$ with  $f_0 = f$ there exists an $\epsilon>0$ such that  $f_t$ satisfies $P$ for each  $t < \epsilon$.
% \end{definition}
% \begin{definition}[Generic]
%     A property $P$ is generic for a class  $C$ of maps $f: M \to  N$ if the set of 
% \end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Sard's theorem]
    Let $f: M \to  N$ be a $\Cinfty$ map. Then the set of critical values of  $f$ has measure zero in $N$.
\end{theorem}
Note in particular that it is the set of critical \emph{values} that has measure zero, not the set of critical points. 

% \begin{definition}[Isotopy]
%     Two embeddings $f_0, f_1: M \to  N$ are \emph{isotopic} if there is a continuous map $H: M \times  [0, 1] \to  N$ such that $H(x, 0) = f_0$ and $H(x, 1) = f_1(x)$ for all $x \in M$ and such that for all $t \in [0, 1]$, the map $f_t$ defined by $H(\cdot , t)$ is an embedding. The map $H$ is called an \emph{isotopy between} $f_0$ and $f_1$.

%     Two submanifolds $S_0, S_1$ of $M$ are \emph{isotopic} if their inclusion maps are isotopic.
