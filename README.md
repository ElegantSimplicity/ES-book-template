## * Morse theory*: a visual guide from handlebodies to Floer homology

I'm doing my masters thesis at KU Leuven in Belgium on Morse theory under the supervision of Charltote Kirchhoff-Lukat.
The goal of the thesis is to state and prove some important results in classical Morse theory, including:

* Existence of Morse functions
* Handlebody decomposition
* Definition of Morse homology and the fact that it does not depend on the chosen Morse function/gradient vector field
* Morse homology is isomorphic to singular homology
* Morse inequalities
* h-cobordism theorem, from which the higher dimensional Poincar√© conjecture follows
* An introduction to Floer homology.

The thesis should be accessible to mathematics master students with basic knowledge of differential geometry. To ease the understanding of the geometrical proofs, the thesis also contains more than 100 figures.

This is a work in progress and should be completed in the beginning of June 2021.

Feel free to use this thesis as a template. It is inspired by the work of Edward Tufte.
